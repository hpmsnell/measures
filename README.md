# measures
This repo houses measure specifications for the [Able Health Measures Library](https://librarian.admin.ablehealth.com).

Further documentation is available in the [Measures Wiki](https://app.tettra.co/teams/ablehealth/categories/194127). A good starting point is the [Specifying a Quality Measure](https://app.tettra.co/teams/ablehealth/pages/specifying-a-quality-measure) article. Measure specifications are written in Clinical Quality Language, according to the [Able Health CQL Style Guide](https://app.tettra.co/teams/ablehealth/pages/cql-style-guide), introduced September 2020. All specifications following this style guide use CQL with the [Able Data Model (ADM)](https://healthcatalyst.box.com/s/pnwty5gidw6sait0cvmrz8r0rbrvplju).

This repo also houses additional measure-related assets such as demo data and risk models.
